# Thousand Sunny - Front-end Internal Assessment

## About the Project

This is the build result of a project developed as part of the **internal front-end development assessment** of the Product team at **[Sem Processo](https://github.com/sem-processo)**. The assessment consisted of developing a complete user interface using modern web development technologies.

## Repository History

The project was initially developed in the **`artursemprocesso`** account and later migrated to the personal account **`ArturGuedes`** for historical and demonstration purposes.

- **Responsive Interface Implementation**
- **Development Best Practices**
- **Ability to interpret and implement Figma designs**

## Base Design

The project was developed following the design created in Figma:
**[Thousand Sunny - Travel Website](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1018985141266376638/thousand-sunny)**

- **Element**: Elements within blocks (e.g., `.header__logo`, `.hero__title`)
- **Modifier**: Block variations (e.g., `.button--primary`, `.card--featured`)
